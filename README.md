# 🎉 My First Website Project

This is my first fully developed website — built using only HTML and CSS — as part of a self-paced course from [freeCodeCamp on Class Central](https://www.classcentral.com/classroom/freecodecamp-html-and-css-tutorial-create-a-website-for-beginners-57869/61893f4059bd9).  
No AI tools were used — just learning and building from scratch!
